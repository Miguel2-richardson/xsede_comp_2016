Projects for an XSEDE conference in 2016.
1st exposure to python.

Project 1 was to build a model to simulate concentration of a medicine in someones system for a given time period.
The goal was to get the concentration above the medicinal level for the time period and keep it below the toxic level.
Additional complexity of caffeine changing the effectiveness.


Project 2 was to build a model to simulate the interaction of mosquitoes and a village infected with malaria over time.
Additional complexity of seasonal fluctuating birth and death rates of mosquitoes added.
